#Maybe , this is the most intricate "helloWorld" that you will have, since it covers nearly everything that you need to know fundamentally about ROS with Cpp. Some examples can be publisher/subscriber format, service/client system, and some basic Cpp like loops, ifelse, function, class, vector, header files and file I/O are also summerized briefly. More intermediate knowledge like opencv for camera sensor and PCL for LiDAR sensor are also will be fully investigated and studied in the near future. I will continuously update this repository so that it will become the best (hopefully) "helloWorld for all" ROS user. That is my main target goal when creating this repo.
